The projects I have created are in C++. 
CSBank Management is my final project in CS111 and is focused on doing CRUD operations through a banking simulation.
Calculator With UD (User-Defined) Functions is simply a calculator program with void functions. It is a practice program for me.
KantoVendoTrial is a practice program of mine using arrays and functions. It is a simulation of store transaction with added features such as taking the payment, and checking if its enough or needs a change.
